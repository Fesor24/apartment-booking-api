Notes
- The problem with strings and any primitive type which are part of your domain model is that they convey no meaning.
To solve primitive obsession and also improve the design of our entity, we can use a Value Object

- An entity is an object that is uniquely identified by its identity

- A value object is uniquely identified by its values which means that it has structural equality which is one of the things
that a record support. Immutability is also a feature of value object which records provide
